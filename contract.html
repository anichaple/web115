		<p>
			I, <a href="https://anichaple.github.io/web115/introduction.html">Ani Chaple</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2023 WEB115 Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
			I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
			As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
		</p>
		
        <p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online 
            or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
