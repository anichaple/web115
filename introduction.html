        <ul>
			<li><b>Personal background:</b>I was born in Camagüey, Cuba and moved to CLT when I was 6 years old so I was pretty much raised here. Although I was raised here, I grew up surrounded by Cuban culture and I’ve gone back several times to visit and see my family. Charlotte is home though:)
            </li>
			<li><b>Professional background:</b>I’m currently working as a piano and guitar teacher at a music school which I really enjoy doing.</li>
			<li><b>Academic background:</b>Graduated from high school right when covid started and everything was shutting down. And now I’m here!
            </li>
			<li><b>Background in this subject:</b>I took Web110 and Cti110 so I’m familiar with some basic html and css but I would like to learn more and practice using it more as well. </li>
			<li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b>I use a macbook air (the M1).</li>
			<li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><em><b>WEB115</b> - Web Markup and Scripting:</em> I want to learn more about Javascript, HTML and CSS and create more projects. I know these are key to starting out as a front end developer.
                </li>
				<li><em><b>CSC121</b> - Python Programming:</em> I’m interested in Python because it's one of the languages that’s growing in the IT community. I feel like more and more people are using it so I’d like to learn more about it.
                </li>
				<li><em><b>CTI130</b> - OS and Device Foundations:</em> I’m taking this course because it helps me better understand computers in general and software and hardware aspects of it.
                </li>
				<li><em><b>DBA120</b> - Database Programming:</em> SQL is widely used in database related jobs so it’s good to learn it just in case I decide to go into something in that area.
                </li>
